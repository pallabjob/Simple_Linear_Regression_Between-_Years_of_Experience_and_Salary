# Simple_Linear_Regression_Between-_Years_of_Experience_and_Salary
📘 Project Summary: Simple Linear Regression — Years of Experience vs. Salary
This project focuses on using Simple Linear Regression to model the relationship between an employee's years of experience and their corresponding salary.

✅ Objective:
To predict salary based on years of experience using a linear regression model.

🧹 Steps Involved:
Data Loading & Exploration:

Dataset contains two columns: Years of Experience and Salary.

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships.

Data Visualization:

Scatter plot shows a strong positive linear relationship.

Helpful in validating the use of linear regression.

Model Building:

Used Scikit-learn's LinearRegression to train the model.

Split the dataset into training and test sets.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

The high R² score indicates a good fit.

Prediction:

Predicted salaries for the test set and visualized the regression line.

Also allowed salary predictions for custom input of years of experience.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Tool: Jupyter Notebook

📈 Key Takeaway:
There is a clear, strong linear correlation between experience and salary. The model can effectively predict salary based on years of experience, demonstrating the power of simple machine learning techniques in solving real-world problems.
